# Cryptography-Blockchain
simple application on hashing and blockchain using PyQt5 and HashLib libraries

Hashing:
In this application use can select the type of hash function and to be used for hashing the input text

Simple Blockchain:
In this application we can see the working of simple blockchain as a demo.
In applicaiton user can add blocks and enter the transaction data in each of them.
And also user can set the difficulty target and nonce for the mining with random trials or
A button is provided which will assists the user to find the right hash value for the given target by mining.

whenever a block header is changed its respective hash is also changes and hash fields of whole blockchain is also updated.
